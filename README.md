# Caesar Cipher Project

## Overview
This project was created using Cline (an AI assistant) in collaboration with Anthropic's Haiku, demonstrating an innovative approach to software development through AI-assisted coding in Visual Studio Code (VSC).

## Project Description
A frontend web application designed to generate a printable Caesar Cipher reference UI. 

## Key Characteristics
- Specify set of words (or input single word) that need to be deciphered
- Set complexity (each +1 adds one additional vowel and consonant to the pool)
- Generate a UI with three sections:
  - Grid/table view of the simplified Caesar Cipher
  - Encrypted word
  - Placeholders to write down the decipher word

## Technologies
- Visual Studio Code (VSC)
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and open `index.html` to view the printable Caesar Cipher reference UI.
